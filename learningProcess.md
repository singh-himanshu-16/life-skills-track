**Learning Process**

**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

**Answer:** The Feynman Technique is a method for learning and understanding complex topics by teaching them in simple terms as if explaining to a beginner, identifying gaps in one's understanding during the process and then revisiting the concepts again.

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

**Answer:** In her TED talk, Barbara Oakley discusses her difficulties in maths and science and how she overcame them by using useful study techniques. She describes the two types of thinking and how they affect learning: dispersed and concentrated. She talks about beating procrastination and gives examples from inventors and artists. In addition to introducing the Pomodoro approach for concentrated work, Oakley emphasises the value of repetition, assessment, and recall in learning and stresses that mastery cannot be attained by knowing alone.

**What are active and diffuse modes of thinking?**

**Answer:**

**Active Mode of Thinking:** This is the state in which you are actively focusing on a task, such as learning a new skill or resolving an issue.

Example: Devoting all of your focus to solving a maths puzzle or learning a new idea.

**Diffuse Mode of Thinking:** In this more at ease condition, your thoughts are allowed to roam. It's beneficial for expanding one's perspective and forming innovative connections.

As an illustration, daydreaming or taking a break from focused attention.
