### Question 2
## Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines in your own words.
*In a video, Professor Carol Dweck defines growth mindset as the conviction that intelligence can be increased through hard work. It facilitates your growth and education. Even though you might occasionally feel powerless, understanding this enables you to change and evolve. It's not to be confused with a fixed mindset, which maintains that your abilities are unchangeable and immutable.*
### Question 3
## What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
*The Internal Locus of influence is the notion that an individual has influence over their own life and outcomes. The Columbia University study that was portrayed in the film found that fifth graders who thought that perseverance was the key to success focused more on easier assignments and showed less dedication to harder ones. On the other hand, those who thought that intelligence was the secret to success were more determined and persistent. The primary selling point of the video is its advice on creating an internal center of control to keep motivation high.*
