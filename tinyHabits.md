### Question 1
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
*Here, it might be wiser to start small with little habits rather than attempting big changes all at once. Three things make up a habit: the trigger (what starts it), the reward (what you get), and the routine (what you do). By even slightly changing one of these, you can more easily form healthy behaviors. It is effective in creating habits.*
### Question 2
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
*According to the BJ Fogg "Tiny Habits Method" video, behavior equals motivation, ability, and prompt, or B = MAP. Should I want to start a new exercise regimen, like working out? Here's a quick hint: Think about B = MAP. 'B' is my behavior, like when I go to the gym. The letter "M" stands for motivation: why do I want to exercise? The clearer my reasoning, the better. Ability is represented by the letter "A"; keep it easy, like a brief workout. Finally, 'P' stands for prompt. Make a note of it or link it to an existing habit of mine, such as exercising after brushing my teeth. When you use B = MAP, forming new behaviors is considerably easier.*
### Question 3
## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
*Since it reinforces the habit in your brain, rewarding yourself for fulfilling a habit is essential. When something makes you feel good, you're more likely to remain with it. As per BJ Fogg, it becomes ingrained to rejoice at every small accomplishment. Adding a positive experience after engaging in a behavior encourages it to continue by telling your brain, "Hey, this is good!"*
### Question 4
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
*The most interesting concept here is to increase your productivity in whatever you do by simply 1%. It's like how a cycling team got much better by making a lot of small changes. This illustrates how small habits and progress over time can add up to something really meaningful. This illustrates the importance of never underestimating the little, steady steps that can lead to tremendous accomplishment!*
### Question 5
## What is the book's perspective about Identity?
*"According to "Atomic Habits," you should think about modeling beneficial behaviors for yourself if you want them to stick. It is more crucial to integrate routines into your identity than it is to just accomplish your objectives. Over time, small changes add up, so focus on being consistent and creating a good identity around your habits.*
### Question 6
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
*Four steps are proposed for habit classification in the book "Atomic Habits": cue, craving, response, and reward. It highlights how important it is to create an atmosphere that makes routines desirable, to rapidly satiate desires, and to ensure that they are simple to establish and maintain. Simplifying and making habits delightful is the aim here, as this will increase the chances of them being formed consistently and productively.*
### Question 7
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
*The book "Atomic Habits" suggests focusing on creating circumstances that make good habits easier and bad habits more challenging, even if it doesn't specifically address making bad habits harder. For instance, if you want to stop chewing, you can move dangerous objects out of reach. The intention is to establish a setting that encourages good habits and makes bad ones more challenging.*
### Question 8:
## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
**Habit: Regular Coding Practice** Cue (When to Begin):

 * Ease (Keep it Simple):  To prevent feeling overwhelmed, start with brief coding sessions.
 * Divide coding assignments into tiny projects or manageable chunks.
 * Satisfaction (Feel Good About It): Honor minor coding accomplishments, such problem-solving.

### Question 9:
## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

* Invisibility (Hide the Cue): Remove unhealthy snacks from places of the house that are visible. 
* Choosing Nutritious Snacks Over Unhealthy Options.
  
 * Non-appealing (Make it Not Fun):  Discover the nutritional advantages of choosing better snacks for yourself.
  
 * Difficulty (Make it Hard): Beforehand, plan and prepare a range of nutritious snacks.
