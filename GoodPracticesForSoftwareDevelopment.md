## Which point(s) were new to you?
**Answer:**
- The majority of the time, communicate via the group chat or channels. Because there are more eyeballs on the public channel, this is preferable than private DMs.
- Never miss a call. Accept the call, tell the person you won't be able to speak with them right away, and tell them you will call them back in five to ten minutes. As an alternative to letting it go down as a missed call, this is far better.
## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
**Answer:**
I need to work on extending my attention span and get better at it.
I can accomplish the above by doing the following: - Consistently turn off my phone. Eliminate alerts from the main screen. Only save alerts for apps that are relevant to your work.
- Disable social media apps while at work.
- Track time spent using applications with features to increase productivity.
- Work out every day.
